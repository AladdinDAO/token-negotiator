# Token outlet

The token outlet is a page that holds the tokens within. It also serves as a component
which can be loaded via an iframe for an end user to interact with their tokens.

# development

`npm run build` - build app
`npm run watch` - watch for changes
`npm run dev`   - build, watch, start server
`npm run start` - start server

# Issues

- The outlet is using exactly the same code from https://devcontickets.herokuapp.com/outlet/ however magic link does not work for this outlet app at present.
